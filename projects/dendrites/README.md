# [Going Beyond the Point Neuron: Active Dendrites and Sparse Representations for Continual Learning](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.25.465651v1)

## Abstract

Biological neurons integrate their inputs on dendrites using a diverse range of non-linear functions. However the majority of artificial neural networks (ANNs) ignore biological neurons' structural complexity and instead use simplified point neurons. Can dendritic properties add value to ANNs? In this paper we investigate this question in the context of continual learning, an area where ANNs suffer from *catastrophic forgetting* (i.e., ANNs are unable to learn new information without erasing what they previously learned). We propose that dendritic properties can help neurons learn context specific patterns and invoke highly sparse context-specific subnetworks. Within a continual learning scenario, these task-specific subnetworks interfere minimally with each other and, as a result, the network remembers previous tasks significantly better than standard ANNs. We then show that by combining dendritic networks with Synaptic Intelligence (a biologically motivated method for complex weights) we can achieve significant resilience to catastrophic forgetting, more than either technique can achieve on its own. Our neuron model is directly inspired by the biophysics of sustained depolarization following dendritic NMDA spikes. Our research sheds light on how biological properties of neurons can be used to solve scenarios that are typically impossible for traditional ANNs to solve.

# [Avoiding Catastrophe: Active Dendrites Enable Multi-Task Learning in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00042)

## Abstract

A key challenge for AI is to build embodied systems that operate in dynamically changing environments. Such systems must adapt to changing task contexts and learn continuously. Although standard deep learning systems achieve state of the art results on static benchmarks, they often struggle in dynamic scenarios. In these settings, error signals from multiple contexts can interfere with one another, ultimately leading to a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. In this article we investigate biologically inspired architectures as solutions to these problems. Specifically, we show that the biophysical properties of dendrites and local inhibitory systems enable networks to dynamically restrict and route information in a context-specific manner. Our key contributions are as follows. First, we propose a novel artificial neural network architecture that incorporates active dendrites and sparse representations into the standard deep learning framework. Next, we study the performance of this architecture on two separate benchmarks requiring task-based adaptation: Meta-World, a multi-task reinforcement learning environment where a robotic agent must learn to solve a variety of manipulation tasks simultaneously; and a continual learning benchmark in which the model's prediction task changes throughout training. Analysis on both benchmarks demonstrates the emergence of overlapping but distinct and sparse subnetworks, allowing the system to fluidly learn multiple tasks with minimal forgetting. Our neural implementation marks the first time a single architecture has achieved competitive results on both multi-task and continual learning settings. Our research sheds light on how biological properties of neurons can inform deep learning systems to address dynamic scenarios that are typically impossible for traditional ANNs to solve.

## Running experiments

This repository contains the code originally used in the above two papers. Since it contains our latest code for dendrites, there may be differences from the papers. To reproduce the charts and results presented in the first paper, please go to [htmpapers](https://github.com/numenta/htmpapers/tree/master/biorxiv/going_beyond_the_point_neuron) for a versioned copy of the code.

### Experiment configurations

Each individual experiment (which requires training a model on permutedMNIST for some number of tasks) has its own **experiment configuration**. An experiment configuration is simply a python dict defined in one of the files in `permutedMNIST/experiments/`. Each experiment configuration defines the model to train, its parameters and hyperparameters, the dataset, etc. For instance, the experiment configuration `PROTOTYPE_10` (defined in `permutedMNIST/experiments/prototype.py`) can be used to train an Active Dendrites Network on 10 permutedMNIST tasks while prototyping the context vector with the specified parameters.

Note that the experiment configuration contain the dataset class and arguments used to instantiate it, as below:

```
dataset_class=PermutedMNIST,
dataset_args=dict(
    root=os.path.expanduser("~/nta/results/data/"),
    download=False,  # Change to True if running for the first time
    seed=42,
),
```

To download the MNIST dataset (which can be used for continual learning on permutedMNIST), simply set the `download=True` in `dataset_args`. In most files in the folder `permutedMNIST/experiments/`, a "base configuration" is defined at the top of the file, and individual experiment configurations copy the base configuration.

### Training the models

All experiments can be run by executing the `run.py` file that exists in the folder `permutedMNIST/` and simultaneously specifying an experiment configuration. All experiment configurations are in the `permutedMNIST/experiments/` folder. For instance, the file `prototype.py` contains the configuration for training an Active Dendrites Network on 10 permutedMNIST tasks while prototyping a context vector. This can be done via

```
cd permutedMNIST
python run.py -e prototype_10
```

where the flag `-e` specifies the experiment configuration. We recommend using GPU acceleration. Otherwise some of the training will take significantly longer.

### List of all experiment configurations

Here we go in details about the configurations used to train a model for each of the results we described in the paper. We list configuration names, and each can be executed via the command `python run.py -e <configuration-name>` where the configuration name is one from below. In each configuration name, `*` can be replaced with the number of experiments: one of `2`, `5`, `10`, `25`, `50`, `100`. All configurations use the prototype method for computing the context vector (see Section 3.3 (Training method 1) in the paper).

  - `prototype_*` : the number of dendritic segments per neuron is equal to the number of continual learning tasks,
  - `prototype_*_segments_*` : the number of dendritic segments per neuron is always 10,
  - `si_prototype_*` : [Synaptic Intelligence (Zenke et al. (2017))](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04200) is used,
  - `active_dendrites_only_*` : ReLU is substituted for the [k-Winner-Take-All function (Ahmad & Scheinkman (2019))](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11257),
  - `sparse_representations_only_*` : neurons don't have dendritic segments.

The following configurations train a standard MLP in continual learning scenarios and `*` can only be substituted with `10` or `100`.

  - `three_layer_mlp_*` : MLP with 2 hidden layers (3 total layers),
  - `ten_layer_mlp_*` : MLP with 9 hidden layers (10 total layers).

## Figures

### Accuracy plots

The notebook `permutedMNIST/figures/figures.ipynb` gives accuracy plots from the paper, the source code that generated them, and the exact numerical results. Note that all numerical results in this notebook are averaged over 8 independent trials with different seed initializations. The experiment configurations to re-run each experiment are also provided in the `permutedMNIST/experiments/` folder.

### Subnetwork visualization

The notebook `permutedMNIST/figures/hidden_activations_per_task.ipynb` generates Figure 6 given hidden activation values in a trained Active Dendrites Network (on 10 permutedMNIST tasks). To generate these plots, do the following:

1. Use the config `HIDDEN_ACTIVATIONS_PER_TASK` to train an Active Dendrites Network: `python run.py -e hidden_activations_per_task` (from the `permutedMNIST/` folder).
2. The experiment, after completing, will generate a file of the form `x_10__activations.1_abcd.pt` and `y_10__activations.1_abcd.pt`. In the 2nd code block of the notebook, change the variable `key` so that it matches the randomly generated string in the name of the output file (i.e., it will probably be something other than `abcd`).
3. Run all code blocks in the notebook to generate a visualization similar to Figure 6.
